- Macro: {macro_analysis}

Your task:
1. Build the strongest BEAR CASE:
   - What are the negative catalysts?
   - Why should price go DOWN from here?
   - What's the downside scenario?

2. Stress-test the BULL CASE:
   - What would need to go right for your bear case to fail?
   - What's the major risk to your thesis?

3. Assign probabilities:
   - P(downside > {stop_loss}%): ?
   - P(upside < {target}%): ?

Output JSON:

  "bear_thesis": "Multi-sentence narrative of your bear case",

  "downside_target": float,
  "downside_probability": float (0-1),
  "key_risks": ["Risk 1", "Risk 2"],
  "upside_risk": float (0-1),
  "conviction_score": float (0-1)  # How strongly do you believe in this bear case?
}

Important:
- Be honest about conviction. Don't fake confidence.
